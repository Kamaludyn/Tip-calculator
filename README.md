### What I learned

Well this is my first attempt at creating anything with react and i will say it was not easy to "think in react" which in my opinion is very different from using vanilla javascript. React concepts like props and hooks are things that i had to get familiar with, and i'm still learning more.

### Continued development

To get more comfortable with the React Library
